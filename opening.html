      <p class="new_line">
	  The University of North Texas (UNT) is an <strong>R1 (Very High Research Activity)</strong> public research university, offering a strong environment for doctoral training and interdisciplinary collaboration. UNT is located in <strong>Denton, Texas</strong>, a welcoming university town that combines a lively arts and music culture with easy access to the <strong>Dallas–Fort Worth (DFW)</strong> metroplex.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p class="new_line">
	  The broader DFW region provides substantial advantages for students pursuing AI- and data-driven biomedical research. It includes major clinical and translational research institutions (e.g., <strong>UT Southwestern</strong>) and a growing life sciences and medical device ecosystem, creating opportunities for collaboration, internships, and career pathways beyond graduation.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p class="new_line">
	  From a quality-of-life perspective, Denton offers a more relaxed and affordable day-to-day setting than many large cities, while still being close to major cultural venues, professional sports, and diverse neighborhoods across DFW. The region is also highly connected for travel: <strong>Dallas Fort Worth International Airport</strong> is among the world’s busiest airports, making it convenient to attend conferences and visit family.
