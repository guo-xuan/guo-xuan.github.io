      <h1>Research</h1>
      <p>High-throughput omics technologies are revolutionizing many aspects of
        modern biology. We are entering the era of Big Data in biology research.
        The massive sample size and high dimensionality of Big Data introduce
        unique computational and statistical challenges, including storage
        bottleneck, measurement errors, noise accumulation, and spurious
        correlation.</p>
      <p>We study data mining, machine learning, big data analysis and data
        fusion. The primary focus of our research is on developing advanced
        frameworks and algorithms to help biologists solve practical problems in
        systems biology, biomedicine, and natural sciences and enable them to
        make full use of massive, high-dimensional data for various biological
        inquiries. </p>
      <h2> Research Areas </h2>
      <h3> Metaproteomics Search </h3>
      <p>Microbial communities drive nutrient cycling in aquatic and terrestrial
        ecosystems and influence the health of human, animal, and plant hosts.
        The metabolic activities of a microbial community can be inferred from
        the proteomes of its constituent microorganisms. In a typical
        metaproteomics experiment, total proteins are extracted from
        environmental samples of a microbial community and then measured by
        liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a
        “shotgun” proteomics approach. Thousands of organisms in complex
        communities lead to a much smaller number of peptide and protein
        identifications in metaproteomics analyses of complex communities than
        comparable proteomics analyses of single organisms. In this study, we
        aim to develop novel database searching and filtering algorithms.</p>

      <h3> Genome-wide Association Studies </h3>
      <p> Taking the advantage of high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism
        (SNP) genotyping technology, large genome-wide association studies
        (GWASs) have been considered to hold promise for unravelling complex
        relationships between genotype and phenotype. At present, traditional
        single-locus-based methods are insufficient to detect interactions
        consisting of multiple-locus, which are broadly existing in complex
        traits. In addition, statistic tests for high order epistatic
        interactions with more than 2 SNPs propose computational and analytical
        challenges because the computation increases exponentially as the
        cardinality of SNPs combinations gets larger. In this project, we design
        fast and powerful methods detect genome-wide multi-locus epistatic
        interactions across multiple cases.</p>

      <h3> Sequence Assembly </h3>
      <p>Next-generation sequencing platforms not only decrease the cost of
        metagenomics data analysis but also greatly enlarge the size of
        metagenomic sequence datasets. A common bottleneck of available
        assemblers is that the trade-off between the noise of the resulting
        contigs and the gain in sequence length for better annotation has not
        been attended enough for large-scale sequencing projects, especially for
        the datasets with moderate coverage and a large number of nonoverlapping
        contigs. To address this limitation and promote both accuracy and
        efficiency, we develop a novel metagenomic sequence assembly frameworks
        and algorithms by taking advantages of high-performance computer and
        cyberinfrastructure.</p>

      <h3> fMRI Analysis </h3>
      <p>An intriguing quest regarding the brain science is: what are the origin
        and the principles behind the functional architectures, which define who
        we are and what we are to a great extent. Compared to other methods,
        functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is one of the most common
        ways that can explore the functional activities of the whole brain.
        After decades of active research, there have been numerous evidence that
        the brain function is realized and emerges from the interaction of
        multiple concurrent neural processes or brain networks. We design novel
        statistic models to analyze functional brain dynamics among the nodes of
        brain networks along time periods.</p>
