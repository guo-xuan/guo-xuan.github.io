      <h1>Undergraduate Research Assistant</h1>
      <p><strong>Background</strong>: Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of proteins measures the mass-to-charge ratio of ions to identify and quantify molecules. A quick overview of MS methodology and instrumentation is <a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/protein-biology/protein-biology-learning-center/protein-biology-resource-library/pierce-protein-methods/overview-mass-spectrometry.html">here</a>. This research program aims to develop novel computation tools for identifying and quantifying proteins of microbial mixtures. Students are provided with the opportunities to learn mass spectrometry techniques and applied programming and practice with MS-based protein analysis.</p>
      <p><strong>Program objectives</strong>:
      <ul>
      <li>•	Provide students with specialized research training opportunities.</li>
      <li>•	Develop strong professor-to-student and student-to-student mentorship bonds.      </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Qualifications</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>•	Applicants should be UNT undergraduate students with training in computer science, statistics, biology, biomedical engineering, or related fields.</li>
        <li>•	Demonstrated proficiency in C/C++, Python, Java, or other programming languages for data analysis.
        <li>•	Ability to prepare manuscripts and evaluation reports for publication and dissemination.
 </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p><strong>Responsibilities</strong>: Student Research Assistants will assist Dr. Xuan Guo in developing the computational methodology to tackle research problems at the forefront of mass spectrometry-based proteomics. The research questions are directly motivated by cutting-edge projects funded by NIH and other sources, ensuring that the work will be highly impactful. Each assistant is required to provide a report describing his/her research and mentoring experience after the program is completed.</p>
      
<p><strong>Support</strong>: $1600 in each month of the three semesters: Fall 2021, Spring 2022, and Summer 2022.</p>

<p><strong>How to apply</strong>: A complete application consists of the following documents:
<ul>
<li>•	A cover letter demonstrating your interest in this fellowship.</li>
<li>•	A reference letter from one of your STEM teachers.</li>
<li>•	A one-page essay describing your aspirations and research-related experiences.</li>
<li>•	An official transcript or unofficial transcript.</li>
</ul>
Please include in your application an indication of when you will be able to begin research.  Preference will be given to students able to start immediately upon selection.
</p>

<p><strong>Contact information</strong>: Applications should be submitted to Dr. Guo at xuan.guo@unt.edu with the subject line “Student Research Assistant.” Questions may be directed to Dr. Guo at the same address.
<p> <strong>Question and Answers</strong>: Several QA sessions will be held online in the following time frames. Interested students are welcome to join and ask questions about this assistantship.
